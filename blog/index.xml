      <description>ELF Load: Dynamic load and execute for your mcu. Perfect, you&amp;rsquo;ve created your embedded system, provided it with an external storage system, created a serial terminal to test things out, and then started your journey through routine&amp;hellip; testing as if you were sitting on an old 70&amp;rsquo;s ticker while you listen to &amp;ldquo;Sheer Heart Attack&amp;rdquo; by Queen (a plus for the sound without a synth)
But wait! This is not totally the old-fashionist experience&amp;hellip; My binaries must be embedded in the firmware in order to work!</description>
