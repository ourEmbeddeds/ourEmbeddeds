      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous articles, you learned how to write initialization code and put
it in the correct place in the processor memory.
Now you will learn how to generate the proper binary for send to ROM and will
see various tricks to simplify your live with gnu make and Makefile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Armv7m Startup (2) - Linker script</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous article, you had learned how to write an efficient
startup code, and play with the options of compiler to produce
the desired code from C, but it is still necessary to put the code
in the correct memory positions to produce an executable suitable
for the cortex-m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present article, you work with the linker script to join all
code in a single well formed executable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most successful families of microcontrollers has been
the cortex-m in its different versions (m0, m0+, m3, m4, m7,
m33, etc), and one of the main reasons of its success is its
simple boot process. In this article, we will travel through the
magical land of code writing and look around the different implementations
across some vendors, culminating with a proposed vendor-neutral startup
schema with many advantages for your projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series of articles I will try to explain the tricks around
code compilation, linker scripts and build systems, proposing
a vendor neutral startup system for your cortex-m project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perfect, you&amp;rsquo;ve created your embedded system, provided it with an
external storage system, created a serial terminal to test things
out, and then started your journey through routine&amp;hellip; testing as
if you were sitting on an old 70&amp;rsquo;s ticker while you listen to
&amp;ldquo;Sheer Heart Attack&amp;rdquo; by Queen (a plus for the sound without a
synth)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
